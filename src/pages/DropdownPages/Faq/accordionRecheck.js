             <p>Every year in the United States, more than 40,000 women's breast cancer cancers are missed on mammogram screenings due to human error. A recheck is the process in which two of our radiologists evaluate your mammograms separately with the use of artificial intelligence. We then compare the results of these evaluations and prepare a final report. You will either receive a report that confirms that your results are all clear, or you will receive a detailed report setting out any red flags for you to present to your doctor. </p>

Please visit the <span>‘Getting a copy of your mammogram’ </span>page to learn how to acquire yours. However, for a recheck, we are able to acquire your mammogram from your medical centre if you provide us with your permission. To do this we will need you to complete a short digital form, which should only take a couple of minutes and can be found here.</p>

            <p>So, how is it possible to get your mammogram checked by two radiologists at that price? </p>
            <p>The answer is our technology. Without our artificial intelligence, an average radiologist would spend a minimum of 35 minutes on a recheck. However, with our artificial intelligence, a radiologist needs just 5 minutes to identify all possible calcifications, benign and malign cells, and other forms of breast complications. The less time it takes for a radiologist to perform the recheck, the less you pay.</p>
